    "### Groups\n",
    "A group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set $G$ equipped with a binary operation $\\cdot$ that combines any two elements $a, b \\in G$ to form another element $a \\cdot b$ (Noted as $(G, \\cdot)$). To be considered a group, the structure must satisfy four axioms:\n",
    "1. Closure: For all $a, b \\in G$, $a * b \\in G$.\n",
    "2. Associativity: For all $a, b, c \\in G$, $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$.\n",
    "3. Identity Element: There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that $a * e = e * a = a$.\n",
    "4. Inverse Element: For every $a \\in G$, there exists an element $b \\in G$ such that $a * b = b * a = e$\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most critical starting points in group theory are the uniqueness theorems. We state that the identity element $e$ in a group is unique; there cannot be two distinct elements that both act as the identity. Furthermore, for every element $a$ in the group, there exists a unique inverse $a^{-1}$ such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = e$. These properties ensure that group operations are well-defined and reversible.\n",

    "An isomorphism is a special type of homomorphism that establishes a perfect, one-to-one correspondence between two algebraic structures. For a map $f: G \\to H$ to be an isomorphism, it must be a homomorphism that is also a bijection (both injective and surjective). While a general homomorphism might \"shrink\" or \"collapse\" a group (like a shadow), an isomorphism preserves every bit of information. If an isomorphism exists between $G$ and $H$, the two groups are said to be isomorphic, denoted $G \\cong H$. "
