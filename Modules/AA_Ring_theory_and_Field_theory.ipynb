    "### Rings\n",
    "A Ring $(R, +, \\cdot)$ is a set $R$ equipped with two binary operations, addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\\cdot$), satisfying the following axioms:\n",
    "- $(R, +)$ is an Abelian Group: It is closed under addition, associative, has an identity, and every element has an additive inverse.\n",
    "- Multiplication is Associative: $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \\in R$.\n",
    "- Distributive Law: Multiplication distributes over addition: $a \\cdot (b + c) = a \\cdot b + a \\cdot c$ and $(b + c) \\cdot a = b \\cdot a + c \\cdot a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Commutative Rings\n",
    "A Commutative Ring is a ring $(R, +, \\cdot)$ where the multiplication operation is commutative. That is, for all $a, b \\in R$:$$ab = ba$$While all rings must be commutative under addition, only \"nice-enough\" rings like the integers ($\\mathbb{Z}$) or polynomials ($\\mathbb{R}[x]$) are commutative under multiplication. Rings of matrices are the most common example of non-commutative rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Units\n",
    "An element $u \\in R$ is a unit if it has a multiplicative inverse ($u^{-1}$) in the ring such that $$uu^{-1} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Zero Devisors\n",
    "A non-zero element $a \\in R$ is a zero divisor if there exists another non-zero element $b \\in R$ such that:$$ab = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ring with Unity\n",
    "A ring that contains a multiplicative identity, such that $a \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot a = a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Characteristic of a Ring\n",
    "The characteristic of a ring $R$, denoted $\\text{char}(R)$, is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that adding the multiplicative identity ($1$) to itself $n$ times results in the additive identity ($0$):\n",
    "$$\\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\dots + 1}_{n \\text{ times}} = 0$$ \n",
    "If no such $n$ exists, the ring is said to have characteristic $0$ . In an Integral Domain, the characteristic must be either $0$ or a prime number $p$. Characteristic $= 0$ means the ring is like an infinite line; you can keep adding $1$ forever and you will just keep getting larger numbers."
